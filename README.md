# Slot-Tagging-of-Natural-Language-Utterances

The goal of this project is to train a model to tag slots in natural language utterances of users addressing a virtual personal assistant. The tagged slots and the associated values are traditionally used to accomplish user requests. For example, if a user asks to learn about movies of a specific director, we would need to identify the name of the director (in addition to the userâ€™s intention to find out about movies and issue a query to the backend knowledge graph to get information for formulating a response back to the user.
